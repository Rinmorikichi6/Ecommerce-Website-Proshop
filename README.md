   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
   ```

4. Run MongoDB

  mongod
 

5. Start the Backend Server

 bash
 npm run dev
  

6.Install Frontend Dependencies

   Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory, and install the necessary dependencies.

   bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
 

7. Set Up Environment Variables for Frontend

   Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory and add the following environment variables.

 Additional Tips

- Seeding the Database: If your project includes database seeding scripts, run them to populate the database with initial data.

 bash
  cd backend
  npm run seed


- Troubleshooting: If you encounter issues, check the console for error messages. Common issues include incorrect environment variables, MongoDB not running, or missing dependencies.

- Documentation: Refer to any project-specific documentation for additional configuration or setup steps.

By following these steps, you should be able to run the Ecommerce Website project locally. If you have specific configurations or additional steps unique to your project, make sure to include those as well.
